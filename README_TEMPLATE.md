# <p align="center">🐡 Pufferfish 🐡</p>

Pufferfish is an alternative syntax for [Jello](https://github.com/codereport/jello)
/ 🪼 [Jellyfish](https://github.com/codereport/jellyfish) 🪼

Jello/Jellyfish is based on the idea that we an build up arbitrary functions by composing builtins (i.e. `sort`, `head`) with just two variadic functions
```c++
is_unary_invocable auto F₁(is_invocable auto ...fns)
is_binary_invocable auto F₂(is_invocable auto ...fns)
```
For example:
```
F₁(F₁(F₁(F₁(tail sort) take 2) pair head) F₁(flat sum))
```

We can make calls to `F₁` and `F₂` implicit by using parentheses `()` and curly braces `{}` to disambiguate whether we are calling `F₁` or `F₂` respectively

```
((((tail sort) take 2) pair head) (flat sum))
```
Closing parentheses (`)` and `}`) at the end of the scope are unnecessary to disambiguate the syntax.
We can replace the corresponding opening parenthesis with `\` and `|` respectively and omit the closing parenthesis.

```
\ (((tail sort) take 2) pair head) \ flat sum
```

Opening parentheses (`(` and `{`) at the start of the scope are again unnecessary to disambiguate the syntax.
We can replace the corresponding closing parenthesis with `.` and `:` respectively and omit the opening parenthesis.

```
\ tail sort . take 2 . pair head . \ flat sum
```

In fact our `F₁` and `F₂` only take at most three arguments. Only when we all applying `F₁` and `F₂` to less than three arguments is it necessary to make `.` and `:` explicit.
We can omit `.` and `:` when we have exactly three arguments:
```
\ tail sort . take 2 pair head \ flat sum
```

### `F₁` and `F₂`

`F₁` and `F₂` are solely determined by the arity of their arguments.
They can be described by the following tables
